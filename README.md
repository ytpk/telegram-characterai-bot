# telegram-characterai-bot
the bot is written using chatgpt. I've never done coding before.
the order of actions that I used to launch the bot.
cloned the repository https://github.com/Yizack/characterai.js
then I created a file there telegram-bot.js . in the examples directory, it can be found in this turnip (but it is very raw and breaks down from any sneeze)
in the .env file, you need to add three lines before starting 
BOT_TOKEN= " "
CHARACTER_ID = " "
AI_KEY = " " 
and the receipt instruction can be found in the api at the link above. except for the bot. it will need to be created via botfather in telegram
